There was a long, empty stretch of road ahead, and I opened up the throttle, pushing my bike to 90. Normally, my girlfriend gets nervous at high speeds—but this time, she just held on tighter and said, “Now I get it… this feeling—it’s like flying.”\nThat moment felt straight out of the movie itself. Pure magic.",
