Reddit,"Does anyone know if non-influencers can obtain the AppleTV F1 Movie gift box?
Pretty much a long shot but I've been seeing on the official Instagram for the F1 Movie that several influencers (and I guess promoters) have been receiving this really incredible looking gift box. It includes things like snacks, race suit looking onesies and a few other things.

Obviously these are promotional packages to hype the movie's release and are likely exclusively for big name influencers. That or people with a heavy social media presence. It's totally understandable but I can't help an be jealous of that amazing looking gift box.

So my question is, does anyone know if there's even a chance of getting one of these boxes for a regular fan/peasant like myself or am I just dreaming here?

Thank you guys for reading!

Reddit,"So yeah whilst the movie definitely left it open to interpretation, this is how I interpreted it;

They've both achieved their life long ambitions by the end of the film. Sonny had been chasing the feeling he's been searching for time and time again; he was able to ""fly"". He found it, and for him it's not a one and done deal. He wants to find it again, so off he goes on that journey once again, leaving behind all the pomp and circumstance of F1 and going to Baja for the pure thrill of racing.

Kate also proved that she was able to stand tall and show the world shes a winner. Everyone who ever doubted herz left her behind, stood against her was wrong; she achieved it. And again, I'm sure this isn't a one and done deal. She's going to chase that again and again, and show the world what she is capable of.

So as the credits role, they are going their separate ways. But I'm sure they have a connection now that runs so much deeper than F1, so when it's time for both of them to retire and pursue a new goal, they can do that together:)",TheGreenDango94,1756422329.0,,3,F1movie,nb7yd03,

Reddit,"We don't know why Kate and her husband quickly got a divorce when she made the move to Formula 1, but the film seems to imply that it was due to either of two things:

1.) Her ambition made him feel insecure and/or unstable in their relationship.

2.) He believed that she would fail, like so many others in her life who scoffed at the idea of a woman (especially one who doesn't come from a racing background) being the tech lead of a Formula 1 team.

I say all of that for context.  

What I personally interpret the ending as trying to convey is:

They're not done chasing their own horizons. They respect that about each other, and are not intimidated by it. There's probably something poetic to be found in the fact that she wants to utilize her understanding of aerodynamics to ""shape the wind"" , and he is chasing the feeling of ""flying"", but it eludes me at the moment. Yin and Yang?  Opposite sides of the same coin?  🤷 

My head canon is that they're both chasing that horizon from opposite ends of the track, and will end up face-to-face, happily ever after at the proverbial finish line, because movie.",UrNotOkImNotOkItsOk,1757247495.0,,1,F1movie,ncw5p81,
Reddit,"I don't know that Sonny so much proposed to Kate in the marital sense as he indicated that he wanted to leave open the possibility of continuing their relationship in the future. Sonny is an eternal explorer, the life lesson he learned in his youth after his accident was that the benefits surrounding success are ephemeral so he built a new identity around the search for moments of purity doing the thing he really loved: racing. He considers everything else surrounding the sport like the money and fame and even the trophies to be ""noise"" and is wary of ever letting them have too much importance to him again. He avoids that noise by constantly taking different temporary driver positions, as one character puts it 'always starting over', that allow him to continue the search for those moments of perfection with minimal fame and glory. This means conventional relationships are challenging; his partner would need to accept the reality of his lifestyle, and there is also a darker element in that he knows the injury in his youth has left him with a heightened risk of death in any serious accident, a fact which he accepts because he would rather die racing than live without it. That and a string of failed marriages probably makes him hesitant, but he indicates to Kate that he is interested in building something deeper with her if she is, and she seems to indicate that she's receptive to the idea.",Shadow101101,1760419516.0,,1,F1movie,njeh9tl,
