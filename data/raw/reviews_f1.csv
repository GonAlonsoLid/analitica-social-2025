YouTube,"When I first saw the advertisements for the F1 movie I knew I had to watch it. I personally am not too into the sport, but the immersive visuals hooked me. At the start, you are introduced to Sonny Hayes, a man whose career almost ended in a brutal crash. Throughout the entire movie, this crash seems to be haunting him, even being the reason as to why he left the sport in the first place. He’s portrayed by Brad Pitt, who I know mostly for his roles as David Mills on Se7en and Tyler Durden on Fight Club. A couple months before I saw the F1 movie, I saw Se7en so I already had high expectations for the F1 movie. Anyway, he goes on to win the 24 Hours of Daytona and meets with his former teammate and close friend, Ruben Cervantes. His friend recruits him into his currently failing team known as APXGP, where he meets Joshua Pearce, a young rising star in the F1 scene. Pearce is played by Damson Idris, a person widely known for their role as Franklin Saint on Snowfall. Throughout the entire story, these two are our main characters. 
	Sonny Hayes' whole role in the entire movie is to be a mentor for Pearce. And that’s exactly what he does. One thing that I loved about Sonny was his calmness compared to Joshua. While Joshua is kind of like a hot head, Hayes keeps his cool in almost every situation. They are essentially the opposites of each other. Also, the evolution of their relationship is something that I thought was great. They begin with having a sort of rivalry and high egos; though, most of this is just Joshua. Thus, as the story progresses more, Joshua starts to kind of understand Hayes and they both create a mutual respect for each other and think of the team first rather than their own selves. In the end, one of the main points of the movie is their bond and how it grows.
	Moving on from the characters, the movie’s visuals are stunning. The movie shows the competitiveness within F1 and helps viewers understand what truly happens on the track. One thing I was surprised to find out about this was that some scenes were actually shot during the Grand-Prix’s. Also, the movie shows realistic racing, but this was something I expected since Lewis Hamilton was one of the producers of the movie. In my opinion, this is something that fits both casual movie watchers, and fans of F1. 
In conclusion, I think this is something that is worth watching. The characters are great, and so are the visuals. I can’t say much except to just tell you to watch it. It’s a great movie which can leave you with an interest in F1. There are many great things about this movie that I didn’t mention like the importance of Haye’s deck of cards. It’s a movie that will have you wondering about the next adventure of Hayes.",@shobone,2025-12-02T17:11:59Z,,0,0,8yh9BPUBbbQ,Ugxj4Q0iDIJTk-GsUC94AaABAg

YouTube,"Not being a particular Formula 1 fan, I didn't focus on the aesthetic boldness of director Joseph Kosinski. So I set aside any comparisons with the harsh realities of this world.
And I'm glad I did, because I loved this blockbuster. Admittedly, the storyline is somewhat farcical, with the sixty-year-old man called in to save a team in total decline. It's a bit like Jackie Stewart, having become a team manager, calling Jacky Ickx back in 2000 to do battle with Schumacher and Häkkinen.
But it's cinema, so it doesn't matter, right? Especially since the racing scenes are impressive. I didn't notice the time passing, and the film still lasts 2 hours and 35 minutes. And then there's the music by Hans Zimmer, of course.
I honestly had a good laugh. Javier Bardem is exquisite as usual, Damson Idris has a beautiful smile, little Kerry Condon is delicious as can be and Brad Pitt is still as cool as ever...

YouTube,"Time has proven that Robert Kubica's haters (especially those damn British buffoons) were wrong. Robert won the WRC2 championship in his first year of racing, driving a non-factory rally car! He also competed in the WRC, driving a DIY car, setting faster times on special stages than Loeb or Ogier, like the Monte Carlo Rally! If only Robert had been given a chance and hadn't joined a team as crappy as the then-Williams under Clair's disastrous leadership, Robert could have easily scored consistently in the top ten, even top five. With such a weak car, worse than the media darling and anointed George Russell, Robert still did his best, and his true class showed at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, where he finished 10th, in a race that was tested by heavy rain, equaling the drivers' skills and technological advantage of the leading teams.  Just look at how George (whom I like) has progressed in his sporting career, currently driving a better car in a top team. Robert was just as good at Williams – note: With One Hand! In short, such a film could easily be made based on a script written by life itself, but the story is unfinished – mainly due to the F1 Williams Racing Team, money, and a lack of vision among influential figures.",@mac_pe,2025-08-01T20:21:17Z,,0,0,8yh9BPUBbbQ,UgxZngd9341bEpvMN_Z4AaABAg

YouTube,"This movie really benefits from the fact it succeeds in its primary job as a movie, which is to entertain. I’ve seen so many movies that try to do so much with the plot that it gets in the way of being something to enjoy. F1 uses a generic plot because the plot is actually a platform to deliver some of the best cinematography and sound design work I’ve ever seen in a movie this year.

As an F1 fan, seeing this movie take place in actual race venues with genuine F1 fans (since they followed the F1 calendar to film during Grand Prix events) made the movie’s setting feel much more genuine even though the story is obviously fictional. The race sequences were amazing, with the actors driving alongside actual F1 racing drivers in their cars.

I think much of the criticism comes from a vocal minority of F1 fans and pundits who believe F1 is “above being portrayed by Hollywood,” which I think is quite ironic given that F1 is quite literally seen as a circus by those who exist outside of that bubble.

I actually think F1 could be a legitimate Oscar contender for some of the technical categories, and even best original song. We’ll have to see, but in general I agree that this was a true summer blockbuster.",@xander0901,2025-07-03T00:00:35Z,,48,48,Cf18Jx4hINk,UgwPVZXr5T2g2HfTpMh4AaABAg

But as an F1 fan the idea of a 60 year old driver worried me for the rest of the film. Michael Schumacher, the statistic GOAT at the time, got called old and past it at 43. If Sonny was in his 40s and the crash was in the mid-late 2000s rather than the 90s (from Drinker's words) it'd be far more ideal.
Brad being 60 playing a 40 year old is one thing. Playing a 60 year old F1 driver...

Honestly, it is a pretty mid movie elevated by brad pitt who brings his usual charisma in a role totally in his confort zone. the racing shoots are also well done even if a lot of the race is viewed through iron man styled shoot. And that's about it. I didn't buy the romance, i didn't buy the whole family dynamic with the rookie, the f1 strategy they used made no sense  and took me out of the movie, most of the characters were stereotyped, and finally, the way the movie was shoot when there was no racing was really lazy: a lot of close up shoot to emphasize what was happening as if we needed it ...

YouTube,"I watched it 2 times. The first time was about me looking for a fun action movie. The second time, was about me doing a team-building activity. I treated my research staff to this movie because I wanted them to understand the value of working as a team.

While the drivers are the ones front and center, the movie shows how it actually takes an entire team to win the races. No role is too small or insignificant. From the team owner singing the checks, to the drivers, the Engineer, Mechanics, Coaches, Analysts behind a keyboard, even to that person who is supposed to properly unscrew a tire had an indispensable role. I love how the movie showed just that. 

Everybody in the team was short of something. The lead driver was talented but was an ego-maniac. The older driver is experienced, but is physically and psychologically scarred. The team owner is losing money, the engineer is inexperienced, the mechanics lack confidence under pressure, but when they all come together they manage to nullify each others weaknesses.

YouTube,"I couldn’t agree with you more, Drinker. It was great to see a “proper movie,” with well-developed characters, a great passing-the-torch story, intense action start to finish, and an ending that was actually satisfying — and unpredictable! Even though I wouldn’t be considered part of the target audience (I’m a straight, single, white female in her 50s), I am part of a larger one — someone who appreciates a well-produced, well-acted, well-written, well-shot movie. In fact, I’d say this is the best movie I’ve seen in the last 5 years. Believe that! 😁 This movie could serve as the catalyst for making more high-quality movies (🤞🏻). As a longtime moviegoer who has been suffering from “super hero fatigue” and is beyond tired of the strung-out sequels and ill-advised reboots, reimaginings, and straight-up redos, I hope Hollywood is paying attention.

YouTube,"I really enjoyed this modern take on the old westerns where a mysterious gunslinger rides into town and is called upon to save the day, passing along their wisdom and maybe learning a little themselves, then ride off alone into the sunset after emerging victorious. Apart from the absence of all the political baggage and rejection of previous generations that has become the norm for the last however many years, it also subverts expectations in a good way for once by avoiding a few tropes that, while not bad necessarily, have been done in a slew of other movies. There's the scene, for example, where JP's friend and manager wants him to go out partying and networking again but JP has matured and realized that it's time to end that part of his life and tells his friend so in coded language. His friend pauses for a few beats and you wonder if this will be another 'sometimes those around you can't grow with you' moment before he surprises by accepting the change without drama. It's a nice moment that acknowledges that sometimes our better angels can win out, as is the case with Ruben who you might expect (rich guy fighting a cut throat political battle with reputation and millions of dollars on the line) would selfishly put his need for a win ahead of Sonny's health but instead shows that his concern and love for his friend is genuine and more important to him than winning or money. The story comes together nicely with plenty of exciting action and twists that keep you on your toes and ends on a positive note that feels true to the characters as they've been portrayed. It's not the greatest movie ever made, but it's fun and well constructed, has heart and, I think, holds up to repeat viewings which has been pretty rare of late.",@persona2grata,2025-10-09T06:50:33Z,,0,0,Cf18Jx4hINk,Ugzwg3bvpkt8M8TRw6h4AaABAg

Kosinski, Bruckheimer, Hamilton. Get the people who are good at doing the thing to do the thing you want done. No need to complicate with Twitter bullshit.

If you wanted to get all pretty about it, you could say that that ethos of ""do only what needs to be done, and do it well"" mirrors the singularity of purpose of F1, and a sort of purity that underlies all competitive sport.

I went to a race in college (Talladega), it was like watching adult bumper cars at 175 mph.  The camping area was the real show, wow!  Anyhow, I'm an F1 fan now, I live close enough to go to the US GP in Texas, but the last time I priced tickets they were insanely high for anything decent.  It's definitely a high end spectator sport, and the average American will just turn their nose up at it, the price and the recent xenophobia that seems to be surfacing lately will keep folks skeptical of the brand, I hope I am wrong.  The new Cadillac team might do well, but I know better, and really, Cadillac racing???  It's a luxury car company for crying out loud, you can't buy a decent sports car from them.  You want a brand to race: bring back Pontiac, or just Chevy. But, with their participation in Indy I doubt GM would want the brand overlap.

YouTube,"Knock NASCAR all you want, Scotsman, but first of all it follows the format of the Roman chariot race -Ben Hur with blades around an oval, death to the competitors in front of thousands of screaming fans. It's the restart rule that puts the cars together to force wheel to wheel racing which you never ever get in F1. When Juan Pablo Montoya drove in NASCAR, he said it was the most challenging series he's driven in. He was not wrong. Having dozens of other cars only inches or feet away at nearly 200mph is a major challenge for any driver. See, F1 focused on the ultimate car, NASCAR focused on the ultimate race. We want to watch the dogfight play out, not watch cars which could be qualifying or maybe racing and who can tell the difference anyway zooming along once every few minutes with no idea who is in front if we didn't have a leaderboard. NASCAR is a gladiatorial spectacle. Or at least it used to be before it became tamed and PC and tried to cater to ""modern audiences"" in it's own way. The other beautiful thing about it was that back in the day, a middle class small business owner could field a team. Cars were not that expensive, and they weren't that complex. It was a blue collar sport for working class people. Surely you can appreciate that.",@jubalbiggs4559,2025-07-06T06:16:23Z,,1,1,Cf18Jx4hINk,UgxP5a0rSlxVhI6RbIV4AaABAg

What was shown on screen is a driver that wrecked like three or four cars in less than one season without finishing first.  No team would hire him as a driver after that performance.  F1 was ok, it kind of felt like it was hampered by producers that didn't want to focus on Sonny's story.  So, instead we tried to have a two stories slammed together.

The race scenes just felt boring knowing only Pearce could mess things up, again: no rival racers 😐. The plot led up to winning a race we all knew sonny was going to win. the ending with the dune buggy was really good but the movie just felt like gran turismo which I say was better, complete meh, you're not remembering it. I'd say a good racing movie would be Ford v Ferrari, and if a movie isn't good, I'm not going to theatres, there are so many classics worth rewatching.

YouTube,"This is the plot  - with all the spoilers. 
Old, experienced white man with few resources but not seeking to enrich himself despite all his natural advantages,  helps a young, brash, rich, self-important black man. The young black man  never stops complaining about the old white man. Despite this, the old white man does everything he can, including sacrificing his own races, to make the black man win. Because the black man is so contemptuous of the old white man,  he sabotages the white man's efforts to help the young black man win. The young black man openly rejects the help and advice of the white man, and when that rejection of advice leads directly in the black man crashing, and nearly dying,  it's the old white man that is blamed and forced to take the emotional burden of being at fault. The movie climaxes at a point where finally, all the white people in the movie put a race win right into the young black man's lap, when another black man (lewis hamilton) takes him out and the old white man has to win the race himself. Old white man ends the movie, not with fame and fortune, despite him saving the day at every turn, but goes on to the next charity race team, this time brown people, to selfless help. The young black man takes the fame and fortune made possible by the old white man and isn't seen helping anyone.
It might be a more accurate social commentary that most people realise.",@JustRootsAndLeaves,2025-07-04T09:26:35Z,,1,1,Cf18Jx4hINk,Ugzi1EWCd5X6bF5DYvB4AaABAg

YouTube,"While I liked it I found while it covered the team strategy quite well, it  really never  sold me on how good these two drivers were. You get a bit at the start with the Pitt character but nothing much going forward. These racers both gain most of their positions by causing or benefiting from cautions. If I compare this to a movie like The Art of Racing in the Rain, (which it lifts lines from verbatim) it just wants you to accept these guys are good but they never show you why they are good. In that way it was kind of a disappointment. I have no faith that the young driver has much of a career going forward.

YouTube,"As a racing fan, I hate the plot. The oldest driver in F1 is 43. He’s also Fernando Alonso, one of the greatest race car drivers period in any discipline. Also when drivers take breaks between seasons’ it’s usually 1-3 years. Not 25. It makes no sense. The only thing that’s possibly comparable is Juan Pablo Montoya returning to IndyCar in 2014 after driving in F1 from 2001-06 and NASCAR from 2007-13, but again he’s one of the greatest drivers in any vehicle. Then there’s this 🇺🇸, the last American to win in F1 was Mario Andretti in 1978, coincidentally the last year an American won the World championship. The last time there was a American PODIUM was 1993 with Michael Andretti.

YouTube,"I'm going to be that guy and say it was a meh movie. We've been so deprived of good media that it seems like it was great in comparison. As an F1 and movie fan, I found it quite boring. Visually striking but movie style editing doesn't suit this kind of racing. I'd much rather have used that time to watch an actual race. I also get that the screenwriters had to add in dialogue that simplifies what's going on but it seems overtly simplistic to someone who knows. It's like a commentator in football going 'this team needs to kick the ball because when they hit it into the net, it means they have scored a goal and the team with the most goals at the end of 90 minutes wins. As far as the story? Same old Hollywood cliches and tropes we've been seeing since time immemorial, honestly they're all like caricatures and not a single character managed to make me think they're a real person. Nothing the characters do makes any sense given what we're told about them because they flip their personalities constantly. It all seemed so contrived. So in short it's a visually fantastic movie for non F1 fans who want a familiar and uncomplicated story. Only good thing in my opinion is that they really did a good job showcasing F1 as a sport and how it works which might create new F1 fans",@shellshocktm,2025-07-18T14:03:37Z,,0,0,Cf18Jx4hINk,UgzD784X0BghVWWijet4AaABAg

Maverick has become one of my all time favorites. But what worked in Maverick, somehow didn't manage to work here (for me, that is).

And the races are too unrealistic to make it a good watch for anyone that's seen anything F1 related over the past few years.

Tech is so good now, watching an actual GP would give more race feeling than this film. For more drama, drive to survive. This is fun to watch because vroom vroom, but that's about it.

Also, 1st time i see Brad Pitt or Bardem act badly.

We've watched it with friends back to back with Rush yesterday, i suggest you do the same. An easy way to realise what we're dealing with.",@florentdevier,2025-10-12T22:17:52Z,,0,0,Cf18Jx4hINk,Ugw-rsCGxVyzkNTSjUV4AaABAg

Top gun maverick? Didn't see it, but I'm pretty sure it's about the classic US military propaganda, which we know now it's over inflated.
A movie about F1? I'm guessing it's an advertisement for the F1 world because the interest is getting low. F1 nowadays it's about politics, lots of money and (in my opinion) lost it's charm. So they do need a boost in sales, hence investing some money in a movie. A 60 years old F1 driver competing with 20 years old F1 drivers?! Pfff....it's a young men's game, not for pensioners, not at a proffesional level anyways. So it's BS from the start. Not gonna watch it. You want to see an excellent F1 movie?
